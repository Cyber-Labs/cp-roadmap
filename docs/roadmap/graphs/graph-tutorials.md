## Basics of Graph and Graph Traversals

1. Read [hackerearth article for basic terminology and graph representation](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/graph-representation/tutorial/)

2. Read the following articles for Breadth First Search (BFS) :<br/>
   (i) [Hackerearth article on BFS](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/breadth-first-search/tutorial/)<br/>
   (ii) [CP-Algorithms article on BFS and its applications](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/breadth-first-search.html)

3. Read the following articles for Depth First Search (DFS) :<br/>
   (i) [Hackerearth article on DFS](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/depth-first-search/tutorial/)<br/>
   (ii) [CP-Algorithms article on DFS and its applications](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/depth-first-search.html)<br/>
   (iii) [DFS using standard color coding and calculating discovery and finish times](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/depth-first-search-dfs-algorithm/)

4. For better understanding of DFS and BFS, [try DFS and BFS visualisation on VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en/dfsbfs)

## Topological Sort

1. Go through [the hackerearth article](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/topological-sort/tutorial/) or [CP-Algorithms article](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/topological-sort.html) for topological sort

## Strongly Connected Components (SCC)

1. Go through [this article](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/strongly-connected-components/tutorial/) for Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCC
2. For C++ implementation of the algorithm to find SCC, refer [this article](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/strongly-connected-components.html)

## Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

1. Go through [this article](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/disjoint-set-union-union-find/) for DSU and its implementation.
2. For more applications of DSU, refer [this article](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/disjoint_set_union.html)

## Shortest Path Algorithms

- Read [this article](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/shortest-path-algorithms/tutorial/) for the implementation of the standard shortest path algorithms - Dijkstra, Bellman Ford and Floyd Warshall. <br/>

:::tip
Do note the time and space complexities and the limitations of each method.

## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

- Go through [this article](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/minimum-spanning-tree/tutorial/) for both Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm.

## Additional Resource

- Sometimes, in problems, it is required to construct a state graph out of the given graphs and then, apply any standard algorithm, to solve the problem. This technique is known as **Graph Modelling**. Refer [this blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45897) for more about it and some solved example problems.

Go through these tutorials, in order :

1. [Hackerearth tutorial for primes, composites, sieve of erasthones, segmented sieve](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/math/number-theory/basic-number-theory-2/tutorial/)

2. [Read upto "pre-computed primes method", from this article on factorisation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/factorization.html)

3. [Number of divisors and Sum of divisors](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/divisors.html)

:::note

Similarly, also remember the formula for **product of divisors** of a number $n$ :

$n^{\frac{d(n)}{2}}$

where $d(n)$ = number of divisors of $n$
